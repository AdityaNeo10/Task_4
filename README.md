# Task_4
This task focuses on using SQL aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), and ROUND() along with GROUP BY and HAVING to summarize and analyze data from an e-commerce database. I wrote SQL queries to calculate total users, total orders per user, total sales per order, average product prices, and more.
